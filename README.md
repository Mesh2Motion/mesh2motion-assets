# Mesh2Motion Source Art Assets

This contains all the source files for art assets. This includes the following
- 3d model files
- 3d control rig files for each skeleton type
- Animations for each rig type

This was separated as this repository will grow the fastest in terms of how large it is. The mesh2motion-app repository will have the final GLB files needed to run the app. This will also make running the main Mesh2Motion app locally much smaller since it doesn't need all the original soure Blender files.
